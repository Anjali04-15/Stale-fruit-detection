# Stale-fruit-detection Using Swin Transformer
# Problem statement: 
The project focuses on using the Swin Transformer, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for the automated detection of stale fruits in cold storage. The goal is to create a system that can accurately classify fruits as fresh or stale based on their visual appearance, leveraging the power of transformers to capture both local and global features. This system will improve inventory management, reduce food waste, and streamline the monitoring process in cold storage facilities.
